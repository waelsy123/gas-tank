## GasTank

**GasTank** is an experimental Ethereum token that derives its value from gas consumption on the Ethereum network. It is designed to challenge the boundaries of decentralized systems by gamifying gas consumption and acting as a store of value for unused block space. 

### Key Features

- **Fair Launch**: Tokens are minted by burning gas, making it one of the fairest token launches on Ethereum.
- **Supply Mechanism**: Initially, each block can mint a maximum of less than 840 tokens, with a yearly halving mechanism in place to reduce supply over time.

### How to Contribute

- **Early Minting**: Engage with the contract by minting tokens and contributing to the network's dynamics.
- **Liquidity Pool**: Consider starting a liquidity pool to enhance the token's utility and market presence.
